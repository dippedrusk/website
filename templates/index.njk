      Hi! I'm Vagrant, a computer scientist, linguist and birder. I am currently a computer science PhD candidate at Saarland University in
      Germany, where I work on natural language processing (NLP), i.e., getting computers to do things with human language.
    </p>
    <p>
      My <a href="work/">research</a> is about measuring and improving the <b>robustness</b> of NLP systems, especially as applied to <b>question answering</b> and <b>fairness</b>.
      I value interdisciplinarity and methodological pluralism, and I am interested in both the social and technical aspects of NLP. On the technical side, I'm drawn to approaches that are more efficient or informed by linguistics. On the social side, I like thinking about the gaps in how we as NLP practitioners define and operationalize concepts like 'robustness' and 'fairness', as well as the societal implications of these gaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      My philosophy on science is that it should do good in the world, for a definition of good that is power-aware at worst and counter-power at best.
      Such science can only be done in collaboration with people outside the ivory tower. Science communication is also an integral part of the science I want to do, and I enjoy giving <a href="talks/">talks</a>, especially introductory ones.
