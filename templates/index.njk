      I do research on <b>social and technical aspects of trustworthy natural language processing</b>.
      In other words, I want to get computers to do things with human language <b>fairly</b> and <b>faithfully</b>.
      My work is currently supported by an Independent Postdoc Fellowship at the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies, before which I did a PhD in computer science at Saarland University.
    </p>
    <p>
      The technical side of my research involves proposing methods and evaluations that are inspired by linguistics (e.g., for <em>pronominal reasoning</em> or <em>question answering</em>).
      On the social side, I investigate gaps, opportunities, and societal implications related to how we define and operationalize abstract concepts in NLP (e.g., <em>democratization</em> or <em>gender</em>).
      In both types of work, I value interdisciplinarity and methodological pluralism.

      You may have known me under a different name but
      <a href="posts/2022-04-30-name/">I go by Vagrant now</a>.
      Please refer to me with <a href="posts/2022-12-03-pronouns/#they%2Fthem">they/them</a> or
      <a href="posts/2022-12-03-pronouns/#xe%2Fxem">xe/xem</a> pronouns, and
      use Mx (pronounced like "mix") if you absolutely must use a title.
      My name is pronounced exactly like the English word, i.e.,
      <span class="ipa-pronunciation"
        >/'ve&#618;.g&#633;&#600;nt.'ga&#650;.t&#652;m/</span
      >, because I love birds and birding.
