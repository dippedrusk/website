      I'm a computer scientist, linguist and birder, and I work on natural language processing (NLP), i.e., getting computers to do things with human language.
      I am finishing a PhD in computer science at Saarland University in Germany, and I am the 2024 recipient of the Independent Postdoc Fellowship at the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies.
    </p>
    <p>
      My research is about both <b>social and technical aspects of trustworthy NLP</b> â€“ especially <b>fairness, reasoning and robustness</b>.
      On the technical side, I propose methods for and evaluations of these aspects that are inspired by linguistics.
      On the social side, I investigate gaps and opportunities in how we define and operationalize abstract concepts like 'robustness', 'bias', etc., as well their societal implications.
      In both types of work, I value interdisciplinarity and methodological pluralism.
    </p>
    <p>
    When I'm not working or thinking about birds, I spend my time on hobbies both conventional (reading almost exclusively non-fiction, listening to metal, writing code or posts for my website) and unique (preserving bugs, etching glass, collecting skull graffiti).

      You may have known me under a different name but
      <a href="posts/2022-04-30-name/">I go by Vagrant now</a>.
      Please refer to me with <a href="posts/2022-12-03-pronouns/#they%2Fthem">they/them</a> or
      <a href="posts/2022-12-03-pronouns/#xe%2Fxem">xe/xem</a> pronouns, and
      use Mx (pronounced like "mix") if you absolutely must use a title.
      My name is pronounced exactly like the English word, i.e.,
      <span class="ipa-pronunciation"
        >/'ve&#618;.g&#633;&#600;nt.'ga&#650;.t&#652;m/</span
