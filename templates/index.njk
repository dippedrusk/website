      Hi! I'm Vagrant, a computer scientist, linguist and birder. I am a computer science PhD student at Saarland University in
      Germany, where I write code in programming languages to make computers do things with human languages - I currently work on low-resource language modelling and domain adaptation for German and English. Broadly, my research interests include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>multi-user text and speech processing</li>
      <li>low-resource settings</li>
      <li>gender, language and tech</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Before starting my PhD, I used to work in industry as a Speech
      Recognition Engineer at Dialpad in Canada. I did a Bachelor's degree in Computing
      Science and Linguistics at Simon Fraser University, during which I also worked
      at an experimental phonology lab, a discourse processing lab, General Electric, an industrial kitchen, and more. I'm also autistic and trans, both of which inform what I read, how I work and what I blog about.
    </p>
    <p>
      My philosophy on science is that it should do good in the world, for a definition of good that is power-aware at worst and counter-power at best.
      (This is difficult under capitalism).
      Such science can only be done in collaboration with people outside the ivory tower. Science communication is also an integral part of the science I want to do, and I enjoy giving talks, especially introductory ones.
