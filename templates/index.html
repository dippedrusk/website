        <p>
          I am a computational linguist currently working in industry as a
          speech recognition engineer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a BSc in Computing Science and Linguistics from Simon Fraser
          University, where I worked at an experimental phonology lab, and a lab
          that took computational approaches to processing discourse. My
          experience has been varied, including work in experimental phonology
          (eyetracking in the visual world paradigm), speech recognition, NLP,
          discourse analysis, and corpus linguistics methods.
        </p>
        <p>My research interests include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>multilingual and multi-user language and speech processing</li>
          <li>phonetics and phonology</li>
          <li>low-resource NLP</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          My philosophy on science is that it should do good in the world and
          actively include those outside the ivory tower. Science communication
          is an integral part of the science I want to do, and my definition of
          SciComm includes engaging the public with my work and communicating
          complex ideas accessibly.
