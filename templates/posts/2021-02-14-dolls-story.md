<poem>Drifting in the breeze, it is unmoored at sea,
Light-headed, light, for the first time it's... free
It was tossed around and cast aside per its owners' whims
Untethered now in uncharted depths&nbsp;â€“ let's see if it swims?
An empty socket where an arm once was, twisted out in rage
Scratches, strange marks taint its body; it's showing signs of age
Its woolen hair is getting wet, its blue dress slowly darkens
Its plastic body gets waterlogged as the abyss gently beckons
No longer can it blow away, it's too heavy now to float
Its lashes flutter up as it's pulled down, water up to its throat
Submerged, terrified and alone, it can't move, it's drowning, fast!
A numbness descends as it is smothered by a flood of memories past
Its glassy eyes stare into the depths and schools of fish swim blithely by
"Why didn't I leave?" she thinks to herself, "Why didn't I even try?"
Anger roils inside her, joined by profound sadness, then fear
It's a maelstrom of emotions and her vision starts to blur
Tears fall as night falls and the moonlight makes the water gleam
Thoughts rattle loudly in her head; she just wants to scream
Currents tug at her dress, whisper comforting words to heal all:
"How could you have left, or fought, or tried? You were only just a doll..."
The castaway listens thoughtfully and the intensity starts to dissipate
Held afloat by the kindly currents, she feels less of the weight
Days, weeks, months go by, bringing the return of her customary joy
She's healing herself and the strength she now has, no one can destroy
She is her own person now, and her scars have a song to sing
To remind her to never again be someone else's plaything.</poem>
