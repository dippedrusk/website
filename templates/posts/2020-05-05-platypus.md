<poem>Then this egg-laying mammalian moving my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the brown fedora it wore,
"Though thy temple be capped and hidden, thou," I said, "art sure no craven,
Sage, mysterious Platypus wandering from the Tasmanian shore—
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"
Per the platypus "Agent P."</poem>
