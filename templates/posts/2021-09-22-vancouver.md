When I landed in Vancouver 6 years ago, it was on an Indian passport. I had some sort of visa to provisionally enter the country, but the real thing I needed was a study permit, which the immigration person at the airport was supposed to grant me. It was late August and lines were long because lots of people were flying in to start school. I ended up having to stand in line for about 3 hours before I got to a counter. The person behind it scrutinized my documents for what felt like ages, stepped away twice to consult with colleagues, and finally came back and denied me a study permit. They said that since I was born in Canada (I was), I was a Canadian citizen, "so welcome home!"

This line haunted me for ages. The full-ride scholarship I had accepted to attend Simon Fraser University was revoked because the offer had been contingent on my being an international student -- which, really, I sort of was! I was 17, I had never had Canadian passports or residency or any of the benefits of those things, and the high commission had been pretty happy to give me a visa on my Indian passport before I flew here! Canada wasn't home to me, it never had been.

The university replaced my full-ride scholarship with a full-tuition scholarship, the highest valued one they could offer domestic students. I told them this wasn't enough, that I couldn't afford the costs, that I had literally picked SFU because of the money they said they'd give me. They told me fine, they'd generously give me a top-up for my first year to cover living costs and books, but that after that I'd have to manage on my own after that by taking out loans.

All of this made my first year very weird and very stressful. In my first term, I took 5 classes, I did a bunch of volunteering, and since I was so stressed about money for the future years, I got a job at the dining hall as a cold prep worker. I was supposed to be scheduled for 15-20 hours a week but there was some sort of mistake or misunderstanding and I was scheduled for 25-30 hours a week instead. I was absolutely terrified that if I pointed out the mistake, I would lose those hours and maybe even lose the job, so I said nothing and just did it. I would get scheduled for night shifts and then go to my 9:30 am classes. Those were the good days, because as the fall turned into winter, I found that if I didn't just stay up all night, it was very hard for me to get out of bed in the mornings. I was used to having sunlight around me at 8 in the morning, having previously lived only in tropical places, and winters up on Burnaby mountain were increasingly dark, cloudy, grey and miserable.

The most frustrating thing in all of this was that I was enjoying so much about university. I made lots of friends very quickly, in the student residences, at my dining hall job, etc., and I was thoroughly enjoying my first few linguistics, computer science and math classes. It was frustrating that I felt so comfortable here, like I could be myself, while simultaneously knowing that I was making so little money on my minimum wage job that I probably couldn't stick around after my first year.

The only person I knew here before I moved was my godfather, Michael, and truthfully we didn't _know_ each other then. Of course, it's been 6 years now and he's one of the main characters of my Vancouver life. In fact, he was the person who got me into birding years ago!
