I'm thrilled to be teaching next summer at Saarland University, and not just as a co-instructor on an existing course!
I [designed a seminar](https://www.lsv.uni-saarland.de/upcoming-courses/seminar-defining-and-measuring-abstract-concepts-in-nlp-summer-2025/) to get Masters students comfortable with conceptual work, something that I'm really enjoying doing these days (see our work on [intersectionality](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3600211.3604705), [names](https://aclanthology.org/2024.gebnlp-1.20/), and [democratization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11598)).
The course is research-focused and reading-heavy (for computer scientists) and I'm looking forward to the discussions we'll have, because I think conceptual work is critical to think about where we are and where we're going in NLP.
I've chosen a selection of concepts in subfields that I'm familiar with—fairness, interpretability and reasoning—but I welcome additional suggestions for conceptual/critical papers.
If you're an author of one of the papers I've selected and would be interested in joining our discussion, I'd be thrilled to hear from you.

<h2>Syllabus</h2>

### Introduction

NLP papers commonly use various abstract concepts like "interpretability," "bias," "reasoning," "stereotypes," and so on. Each subfield has a shared understanding of what these terms mean and how we should treat them, and this shared understanding is the basis on which datasets are built to evaluate these abilities, metrics are proposed to quantify them, and claims are made about systems. But what exactly do these terms mean? And, indeed, what _should_ they mean, and how do we measure that? These questions are the focus of this seminar on defining and measuring abstract concepts in NLP.

In two week cycles, we will cover various concepts in NLP research from the selection below. We will read papers that analyze or critique how a given concept is used, and then we will use this as a lens to read, discuss, and critique three recent NLP papers that use that concept. We will also try to reimagine how we would run these projects and write these papers in light of what we have learned.

### Course Requirements

1. **Present** a concept and lead a discussion about it (a sample will be given of what this should look like) – 35%
2. **Engage** with presentations about other concepts – 30%
3. **Write** a report designing an NLP project involving the concept that is either novel or a reimagination of one of the papers we saw in the seminar – 35%

### Learning Objectives

This course will help you acquire / practise the following skills, among others:

- How to **read and critique papers** (both interdisciplinary and more conventional NLP papers)
- How to **critically evaluate aspects of conceptualization** (defining an abstract concept) **and operationalization** (creating empirical measures of the abstract concept), towards answering questions like: What does X mean? How do we translate our conceptions of X into something that we can observe and measure? How, concretely, can we measure it—with data and metrics and gold labels and an evaluation strategy? What _should_ X mean? How do our choices in defining, conceptualizing and operationalizing X lead to gaps in how we make claims about X?
- How to **design NLP projects** in ways that address critiques and push the discipline forward

### List of Concepts

We will choose a subset of the following topics based on class size and student interest: **robustness, stereotypes, interpretability, explainability, paraphrases, bias, race, emergent abilities, gender, generalization, names, reasoning.**
I may add further topics, including understanding, intelligence, accountability, memorization, trust, etc., depending on interest.
Each concept is listed below with a paper that does a critical or conceptual analysis (sometimes with a survey) of it. In addition, other papers that use the concept are listed here for us to discuss and evaluate.
