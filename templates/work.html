      <h4 id="gender-gap-tracker">Gender Gap Tracker</h4>
      <p>
        This project seeks to quantify gender bias in the media by counting the
        proportion of people quoted in news text who are women. To do so, we
        developed a system that analyzes articles published online by certain
        English-language Canadian news outlets, using parts we built in
        combination with off-the-shelf NLP tools.
      </p>
      <em>
        <p id="gender-gap-tracker-nb">
          Nota bene: This project uses gender analysis that has some notable
          flaws. Although we have three categories of gender—male, female and
          other—the 'other' category lumps together cases where the speaker's
          gender is unknown as well as where the speaker's gender is known to
          fall outside the binary. Furthermore, our system depends on databases
          that encode binary gender (which erases nonbinary people) and on other
          NLP systems, e.g., for coreference analysis, that are known to have
          significant performance gaps for resolving instances of singular they
          and for English neopronouns (ze/hir, xe/xyr, etc.). We have manual
          overrides for (famous) people whom we know are systematically
          misgendered by these systems we depend on, but for most cases, we make
          probabilistic guesses at a person's gender based on their name - a
          problematic and cissexist practice. This impacts the accuracy of all
          reported results and we discuss these ethical considerations and more
          in our paper (currently under review).
        </p>
        <p>
          Gender is fluid and personal, and therefore "gender recognition" as a
          concept is impossible to do. At the same time, equitable
          representation in the media is important, and all previous manual
          attempts at quantifying this gender gap in media quotes have required
          orders of magnitude more time and labour, while still suffering from
          many of the same assumptions (e.g., correlating certain names with a
          gender, assuming pronouns unambiguously tell you someone's gender,
          etc.). Self-reported gender for speakers quoted in newspaper articles
          is not information that reporters collect, though this would be how to
          do this research in a perfect world.

      <h4>TACT: Topic Analysis, Constructiveness and Toxicity</h4>
      <p>
        This project analyzed millions of online comments on English news
        articles to examine toxicity, constructiveness, and content in this
        genre and their interplay. Our results paint a more positive picture of
        the internet than our lay perceptions because it turns out that
        moderated comment sections are quite constructive. Our findings yield
        insights for news outlets to moderate comments and advise commenters, as
        well as for internet citizens looking to have more meaningful
        interactions with others online.

      <h4>Adverbly Adjectives</h4>
      <p>
        This project aimed to create a semantic classification of the [adverb-ly
        adjective] construction - an adjective modified by an adverb ending in
        'ly'. I used R and Python to computationally extract, count and classify
        instances of these constructions in large corpora (<a
