Vagrant dressed in all black, a black mask and black round sunglasses. A carabiner with keys hangs from a belt loop and a tote bag from the Deutsche Kinemathek (German film museum) hangs from their shoulder as they lean against a backrest in a tram, showing a tattooed forearm. Their t-shirt says "Saarbrigge, du Geiler!" because it is from Saarbr√ºcken.
