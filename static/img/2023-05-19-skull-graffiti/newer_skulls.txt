18 newer skulls numbered in the 200s and 300s, all but one of which are yellow. Almost all have closed jaws and inverted heart shaped noses. There is more diversity in this set, including a masked skull, a worried skull, a skull with sunglasses, and a skull eating bricks. The last of the skulls is significantly larger and painted onto the side of a building with something other than spray paint, unlike the rest of the skulls.
