Scatterplot of 61 points on a map of Saarbrücken city, titled 'Locations of a subset of Saarbrücken skulls'. Each dot represents a numbered skull and is labelled and colour-coded with its number, with darker colours representing lower numbers. The map shows a concentration of skulls in the central part of the city. Further out, there are skulls on both sides of the river Saar as well as on several main roads that are important enough to be shown on the map. There are multiple 18s in Alt-Saarbrücken, and a cluster of skulls from 80 to 92 between the neigbourhoods of Sankt Johann and Rotenbühl. Some other places appearing to have been visited on multiple occasions, e.g., numbers 65, 201 and 350 are all located near Römerkastell.
