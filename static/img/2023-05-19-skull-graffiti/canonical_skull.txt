Skull number 83. It is a prime example (pun intended) of this style of graffiti, thickly outlined in black and filled with silver spray paint. It's a two-dimensional, almost Picassoesque caricature of a leftward facing skull, with a completely angular left ear and jaw, in stark contrast to the roundness of the top of the skull and the right ear. There is no depth to the mouth with its two flat rows of bared teeth (six above, five below), yet the skull appears surprisingly expressive. The artists seem to achieve this by adding (live) human facial features such as black irises within the elliptical eye holes that look cheekily sideways at the observer, and semi-circular "eyebrows" that give it an air of surprise. There are other squiggles and dots on the skull that add dimension.
