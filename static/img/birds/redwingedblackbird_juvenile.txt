A juvenile male red-winged blackbird fluffs its feathers at the edge of a pier to warm up because it is now fall weather. This bird has gorgeous, intricate brown and buffy streaks all over its body, and a little yellow patch where it will probably eventually grow a red and yellow shoulder patch as is characteristic for male red-winged blackbirds.
