A rufous hummingbird lying prone on a wooden deck. It flew into a bird-proofed window and fell onto the deck and was stunned for a few hours but eventually managed to fly away. Its called a rufous hummingbird because its feathers are rufous, i.e., reddish-brown. This closeup shows its pointy black bill and the rufous feathers, and this bird is a male because of its bright red and iridescent "gorget," or throat feathers.
