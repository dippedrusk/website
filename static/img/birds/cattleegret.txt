A brown cow takes up almost the entirety of the frame and a cattle egret walks at its feet. The cow has a rope around its neck tying it to a tree nearby and it is grazing. The cattle egret is a medium sized bird with black legs, mostly white feathers that are tinged slightly yellow in parts, and a yellow bill.
