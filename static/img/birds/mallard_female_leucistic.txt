A leucistic female mallard floats in water. It is not an albino duck because albino ducks have a complete absence of melanin (all its feathers would be light and its eyes would be pink) whereas this one has some patches of darker feathers and it has brown eyes, indicating decreased melanin rather than a complete lack of it altogether.
