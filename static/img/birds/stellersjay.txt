A Steller's jay cheekily grabs a peanut at a feeder full of peanuts. This jay has a lot of gorgeous blue feathers and a black head with a little crest that is raised. They used to come to this feeder and stock up on more peanuts than they could eat at a given time, and then presumably hoard them somewhere.
