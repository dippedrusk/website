Close-up of the head of a male wood duck in eclipse plumage. Male wood ducks are normally very dramatic-looking with bold lines and bright colours. This one retains its red eye colour and pinkish-yellow bill but it loses all the bright blue-green, iridescent feathers on its head, including the ones that make the fancy crest it has. Since this one is in the middle of moulting there are still traces of some brightly coloured feathers that haven't quite fallen out yet.
