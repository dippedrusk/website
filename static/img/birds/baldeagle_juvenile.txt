Close-up of the head of a bald eagle in its third or fourth year. It doesn't have the fully white characteristic bald head yet - the head has several white feathers but also some brown feathers. Its beak is a nice bright yellow and its breast feathers are a pretty shade of brown. It looks to the left with a piercing gaze.
