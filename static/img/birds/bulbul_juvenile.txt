A young red-cheeked bulbul is nestled cozily inside its nest of twigs. The nest was well-hidden within some other branches through which this picture is taken, so the view of the bulbul is as if through slats. This bulbul is has a black bill and is black on the top half of its head and white on the lower half, except for a bright red patch on its cheek that gives it its name.
