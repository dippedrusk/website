A spot-billed pelican soars in the airs with its wings spread directly outwards. It's a large white bird with the large throat pouch that is characteristic to pelican species. This pelican has a splotchy pink pouch and a pink and yellow bill. It looks sort of underslept because it has a pink ring of skin around its eyes and its legs are tucked under it while it flies.
